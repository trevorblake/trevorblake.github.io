    <p> <strong>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?</strong> 
	I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.

	He had such a knowledge of the 
	dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from

	some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only 
	thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, 
	of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice 
	everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. 
	<strong>Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.</strong>
